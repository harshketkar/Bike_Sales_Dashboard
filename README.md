# Bike Sales Analysis Dashboard

This Excel dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of bike sales data, offering valuable insights into customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and regional trends. It empowers users to explore the data interactively and identify key factors influencing sales performance.

**Project Overview:**

This project aimed to create an interactive dashboard that would allow stakeholders to easily understand bike sales trends. The data was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and consistency before being used to generate dynamic visualizations. Pivot tables were the core component of the dashboard, enabling the creation of insightful summaries of the data. Interactive filters were then implemented to allow users to drill down into specific segments of the data and perform more granular analysis.

**Work Done:**

1.  **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** The raw data was thoroughly cleaned to ensure data quality. This included:
    *   Handling missing values using appropriate techniques (e.g., imputation or removal).
    *   Converting data types to ensure compatibility with calculations and visualizations.
    *   Generating new columns to facilitate visualization creation and provide additional insights.  *(Age Bracket)*

2.  **Dashboard Creation (using Pivot Tables):**  Pivot tables were used to summarize and aggregate the data, forming the basis of the dashboard visualizations. The following dashboards were created:
    *   **Average Income per Purchase:** This dashboard displays the average income of customers making bike purchases, segmented by relevant categories. This helps identify which customer segments are most valuable.
    *   **Customer Commute:** This dashboard visualizes customer commute patterns, showing the distribution of customers based on their primary mode of transportation. This information can be valuable for targeted marketing campaigns.
    *   **Customer Age Bracket:** This dashboard presents bike purchases broken down by customer age bracket, providing insights into the popularity of different bike types among various age groups.

3.  **Interactive Filters:**  Interactive filters were implemented to enhance the dashboard's analytical capabilities. Users can filter the data by:
    *   **Marital Status:** Analyze sales trends based on the marital status of customers.
    *   **Region:** Explore sales performance across different geographical regions.
    *   **Education Level:** Understand how education level influences bike purchasing decisions.

**Key Features:**

*   **Interactive Exploration:** The dashboard allows users to interactively explore the data using filters, enabling them to answer specific business questions.
*   **Data-Driven Insights:** The visualizations provide clear and concise insights into bike sales trends, customer demographics, and regional performance.
*   **Actionable Information:** The information presented in the dashboard can be used to inform marketing strategies, product development, and sales decisions.
